# HTTPS Everywhere user-contributed rules

Upstream: `git://git.torproject.org/schoen/https-everywhere.git`

This repository contains my custom rules for [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/), a Firefox extension that assists you in using SSL-encrypted connections to websites where feasible.  You're welcome to use them or suggest modifications, but you'd be better served to track the upstream repository, which is receiving submissions from many more people.

More information is on the [development page](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/development).
